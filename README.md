## What it covers

- **UI microcopy** — buttons, errors, empty states, tooltips, form labels, notifications
- **Product flows** — onboarding, upgrade, settings, permissions
- **Marketing pages** — hero sections, feature blocks, CTAs, pricing

- **Copy review** — flag dead words, fix tone mismatches, cut filler

## How it works

The skill follows one rule: **Clarity > Respect > Character.** Always in this order.

Every line gets checked against a 7-point filter:

1. Understandable in 3 seconds?
2. "Why should I care?" answered?
3. At least one concrete detail?
4. Can cut 30% without losing meaning?
5. Expectations honest?
6. Next step obvious?
7. Sounds human?

Two or more "no" = rewrite.

## The philosophy

Most AI copy fails because it starts with character and skips clarity.

Sayless starts with clarity. Always.

If a word can live on 1,000 websites unchanged, it's dead.
If a claim has no proof, it's hype.
If a sentence has no verb, it's decoration.

Say less. Mean more.
